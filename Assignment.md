Final Project 
Due Jun 3 by 11:59pm Points 100 Submitting a text entry box or a file upload Available after Apr 1 at 6pm
Learning Objectives
By the end of the final project, a student will:

have experience building a back-end application from start to finish
have used basic and advanced features of mongo and express to build something they are proud of
have confidence in their code through the presence of thorough tests they write themselves
Overview
You’ll build a complete API from scratch
It should be a useful project - creates value for the user
Constructed around a real-world situation of your choosing
You may optionally find a data set to initially populate your database with
Requirements
Your project will require an Express API using:
Authentication and Authorization
2 sets of CRUD routes (not counting authentication)
Indexes for performance and uniqueness when reasonable
At least one of text search, aggregations, or lookups
You may use external data providers (APIs) if you can get yourself free trial/tier access
Please give us a token or instructions on how to get our own, if applicable
Routes should be fully tested (project test coverage > 80%)
You’ll demo your project to the class in week 10 (5 minutes)
Demonstrate how to interact with your API through either
A saved Postman collection
A very simple front-end project
Please have your camera on
Project Phases
Week 5: brainstorm project idea 
Week 6: submit project proposal with task breakdown and timeline
Week 8: prototype/proof of concept 
Week 10: project submission, presentations
~5-8 minute presentation with slides and a demo.
Your project README should have a self-evaluation of your approach and results, what you learned, and what you would like to do differently or improve upon. Explain what worked well and what didn't. The expectation is that this will not be a brief statement.
